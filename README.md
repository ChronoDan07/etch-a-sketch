This an implementation of HTML CSS and JS of a program that acts as in-browser scribbler. The number of "pixels"/divs can be changed using the input at the bottom of the menu buttons. It also features some more advanced functions like 
rng color: which provides a random color to scribble with;
dodge: which changes the lightness of the color by 10% on each press or drag;
burn: which changes the darkness of the color by 10% on each press or drag;
eraser: which as the name suggests erases(sets the color to white) of a pixel/div
